How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  The way I have interpreted the user needs is by asking the proper question and understanding what it is that really needs to be implemented in order to properly meet their needs. For example, if the user's issue is that they need a easier way to tag something or navigate from "x" page to another there could be a bar implemented on the side of the site in order to fix that small issue in a much more larger issue as it may pertain to a multitude of users and not just that user's submission. The user stories help with this because it gives us real feedback so we can adapt and access to their needs and fix the issue at hand so we are showing that we want to fix issues that users may not like.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  The best agile processes for future development work that I'd like to utilize is the daily meetings. I feel that is the major thing that any corporation that doesn't use it already should definitely utilize. I think it will greatly assist the workflow of any company and make a massive change in terms of communication and everyone being on the same page. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Being a good team member means being honest and doing your part. If you do your part and give every project your all you can't go wrong. Constantly communicating with your team and being transparent with them will lead to better results regardless of what issues arise. Never take on too much and not effectively communicate that to your team because that could cause for long term issues. At the end of the day communication, honesty, and integrity will make you an exceptional member in software development and actually any occupation in general.
